Example for Configuration of deepzoom service

h1. Example: Configure on Ubuntu with Tomcat7

To run the deepzoom service on production it's advised to configure directories for temp files and cached tiles outside the webapp directory. As deepzoom does not provide an install script some steps have to be done manually.

The example given relies on the ubuntu convention for contextes outside the webapp. Pathes can be configured to your needs 

h3. 1. Create base directory for temp files and cached tiles:

pre.. sudo mkdir /usr/share/tomcat7-dzdata
sudo mkdir /usr/share/tomcat7-dzdata/dzdata
sudo mkdir /usr/share/tomcat7-dzdata/dzdata/temp
sudo mkdir /usr/share/tomcat7-dzdata/dzdata/tilesCache
sudo chown -r tomcat7:tomcat7 /usr/share/tomcat7-dzdata


h3. 2. Create context as dzdata.xml in /etc/tomcat7/Catalina/localhost/

pre.. sudo touch /etc/tomcat7/Catalina/localhost/dzdata.xml
sudo echo '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<Context path="/dzdata" 
	docBase="/usr/share/tomcat7-dzdata/dzdata" 
	antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true" />' >> /etc/tomcat7/Catalina/localhost/dzdata.xml

h3. 3. Change deepzoomer.cfg accordingly

pre.. # config file for the hbz deepzoomer Service based on 
# VIPS
tempDir = temp
resultDir = tilesCache

# Server config
workingDir = /usr/share/tomcat7-dzdata/

# Client config
protocol = http
host = localhost
port = 8080
path = deepzoom
# change wdPath if you want to have your cached data outside webapp dir
wdPath = dzdata
